# Feudalism
Continuing with Feudalism game that I built for the console in C++, now using Visual Studio and C# to create it.

It's being designed for flexibility, so that you can easily change names, traits, and other variables in the CSV files so it can be 
used for anything you want. I'm designing it with Ireland around the year 1000, but with different CSV files and minor changes to the 
interface it can be used with anything.
